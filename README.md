# DeadwoodGame
Deadwood is a boardgame I developed with a partner using java and javafx GUI as a school project in 2020. Unfortunatly I lost my
school git account and many of the projects along with it. The last version of Deadwood that I had been able to recover was unfinished
and this is a restored version.
